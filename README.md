# Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on textual reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify the sentiment of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. This repository includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation scripts to provide a comprehensive solution for sentiment analysis tasks.
# Features
* __Data Preprocessing__: Clean and prepare the text data by removing noise, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and other essential preprocessing steps.
* __Model Training__: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models (e.g., RNN, LSTM) for sentiment classification.
* __Evaluation__: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* __Visualization__: Visualize the data distribution and model performance using graphs and charts.
# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
__Description__: 
One of the oldest and most comprehensive libraries for NLP in Python.
* Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
* Part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition
* Text classification, parsing, and semantic reasoning
__Ideal for__: Beginners and educational purposes, as it provides extensive documentation and resources.
# VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
* Description: VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text. It is part of the NLTK library but can be used as a standalone tool as well.
# Use in :
* Sentiment Analysis: Provides a compound score that ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive), along with positive, negative, and neutral scores.
* Lexicon-Based: Uses a predefined dictionary of words and their corresponding sentiment scores.
* Social Media Focused: Handles common social media abbreviations, slang, and emoticons effectively.
# When to Use VADER
* Social Media Analysis: Ideal for analyzing sentiments in tweets, Facebook posts, reviews, etc.
* Quick Sentiment Assessment: Suitable when you need a quick and reliable sentiment score without extensive training.
* Resource-Limited Environments: Efficient for use cases where computational resources are limited, as it does not require model training.
# SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is a key component of the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool. It is designed to provide a robust and nuanced analysis of sentiment in textual data.
## Key Features
* __Compound Score__: Provides an overall sentiment score ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).
* __Positive, Negative, Neutral Scores__: Offers additional granularity by providing separate scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
# RoBERTa Pretrained Model
RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) is a transformer-based model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, designed to improve upon BERT by utilizing optimized training techniques and larger datasets. Developed by Facebook AI, RoBERTa has set new benchmarks in various NLP tasks.

## Key Features
* __Improved Pretraining__: RoBERTa uses dynamic masking, larger mini-batches, and longer training times compared to BERT.
* __Larger Datasets__: Trained on significantly larger datasets, including the Common Crawl dataset.
* __Model Variants__: Available in base and large configurations, analogous to BERTâ€™s base and large models.
